# Stack

## Brief
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

## :hourglass: Complexity

| Operation     | Average       | Worst case   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Space         | **O(1)**      | **O(1)**     |
| Push        | **O(1)**  | **O(1)** |
| Pop        | **O(1)**  | **O(1)** |
| Peek        | **O(1)**  | **O(1)** |


## Operations

1. `Stack()` - creates a new empty Stack.
1. `push(value)` - inserts a new element to the top of the stack.
1. `pop()` - delete the element at the top of the stack.
1. `empty()` - check if the stack is empty.
1. `clear()` - clear the stack.
1. `size()` - return the size of the stack.
1. `top()` - return the element at the top of the stack.
